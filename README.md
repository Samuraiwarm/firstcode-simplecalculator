SimpleCalculator for Thinc First Code

This example will give you the basics of Kotlin syntax and intro to extra features of Kotlin (if you know Java).

## Included materials

- val/var declaration
- nullable "?" data type
- using methods and accessing properties of variables in Kotlin (and in most languages)
- getting id's from objects in layout
- when(variable){} (equivalent to switch-case in Java)

# Next example coming soon: BNK48Randomizer(?)

Basically, you put in number (from 1 to 48), and the app will random you one of the BNK48.

The next example will explain more about sending data between activities using Intent.

- Intent
- null-asserted "!!" data type
- ArrayList
- HARDMODE: RecyclerView (Displayed BNK48 history + comments)

To be decided:

- Load image with GlideApp or AsyncTask, or just save in the project
- When can I explain about Activity Lifecycles omfg
